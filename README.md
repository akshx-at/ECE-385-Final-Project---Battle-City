# ECE-385-Final-Project---Battle-City
This project was created as a final project for my Digital Systems class at UIUC. Me and partner built a multiplayer game on a FPGA called Battle City   The game drew inspiration from the original game of Battle tank 1990.
Through the course of this lab we aimed to build a retro game called Battle city which took inspiration from an original game of Battle Tanks 1990. It’s a multiplayer game which focuses on the fact that the two players will go around shooting each other with the multiple bullets that are there at their disposal with the tanks losing their health everytime a bullet touches them and the first the tank to lose all their health loses the game. The game at its basis is focused around VGA display and mixing game logic to plan and design the entire game. To start with the design, we started looking at lab 6.2 code and modified it to meet our requirements. We decided to plan our design to first focus on getting the game logic for one tank and then expand to the second player.

Our design is based on the SoC supported by a DE-10 Lite FPGA board. The physical movement and collision detection aspects of the game were handled by hardware modules defined in .sv files. The DE-10 board’s on-chip memory was used to store the attributes of tanks, obstacles and other sprites The NIOS II CPU was used to interface with the USB keyboard in order to access the standard gaming “WASD” keys for the first tank and then the ‘arrow’ keys for the second tank along with the spacebar and enter for firing bullets. The main point of interaction between the FPGA board and user controls were taken care of by the C code that was written to store the keycodes that came in and to display the characters and sprites on the monitor using a VGA cable.
